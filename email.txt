Subject: Product Filtering Tool – How to Use

Hi Clara,
I hope you're doing well.

As we discussed, I’ve finished developing the app that allows you to automatically filter products in the spreadsheet using the filters you choose. Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to use it:

How to use:
1. Open the app using this link:

2. Use the form to select any filters you’d like — they’re completely optional.  
   - You can leave all fields empty to see all rows.  
   - You can also filter by any number and combination of fields you'd like, such as gender and size.

3. Click the "Filter" button. The filtered results will appear in the same page.  
   - To apply new filters, click "Back to filters" at the top of the page to return to the form.

The tool is already installed and deployed — no technical setup is required. Just open the link and use it.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best regards,
